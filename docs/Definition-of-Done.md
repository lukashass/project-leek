# Definition of Done

## Issues

An issue is finished successfully when:
- all of the issue's contents are solved
- the changes are pushed to its branch (created when assigning yourself)
- a pull request to master is opened and successfully closed:
 - all PR-checks successful (build, linting, test, type-check)
 - the changes have been reviewed and approved by two reviewers
 - all open conversations have been resolved

Only then can the issue be closed (can be done via PR).

## Milestones

A milestone was finished successfully when:
- all issues attached to the milestone are finished
- a short presentation about the changes of the milestone is made
- the presentation is reviewed and approved by the whole team

These things must be done before the review with the customers.
